# RULES #

#/
# Checks whether shell script linters are installed.
#
# @private
#
# @example
# make check-shell-linters
#/
check-shell-linters: check-shellcheck

.PHONY: check-shell-linters

#/
# Lints shell script files.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   This rule is useful when wanting to glob for files, irrespective of context, for a particular directory in order to lint all contained shell script files.
#
# @param {string} [SHELL_FILTER] - file path pattern (e.g., `.*/_tools/.*`)
# @param {*} [FAST_FAIL] - flag indicating whether to stop linting upon encountering a lint error
#
# @example
# make lint-shell
#
# @example
# make lint-shell SHELL_FILTER=.*/_tools/.*
#/

ifeq ($(SHELL_LINTER), shellcheck)
	$(QUIET) $(MAKE) -f $(this_file) shellcheck
endif

.PHONY: lint-shell

#/
# Lints a specified list of shell script files.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   This rule is useful when wanting to lint a list of shell script files generated by some other command (e.g., a list of changed shell script files obtained via `git diff`).
#
# @param {string} FILES - list of shell script file paths
# @param {*} [FAST_FAIL] - flag indicating whether to stop linting upon encountering a lint error
#
# @example
# make lint-shell-files FILES='/foo/file.sh /bar/file.sh'
#/
