# RULES #

#/
# Checks whether Python linters are installed.

# @example
# make check-python-linters

.PHONY: check-python-linters

#/
# Lints Python files.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   This rule supports the environment variables supported by each context-specific (`lint-python-<context>`) prerequisite.
# -   This rule is useful when wanting to glob for files, irrespective of context, for a particular package/directory in order to lint all contained Python files.
#
# @param {string} [PYTHON_SOURCES_FILTER] - file path pattern (e.g., `.*/foo/bar/.*`)
# @param {*} [FAST_FAIL] - flag indicating whether to stop linting upon encountering a lint error
#
# @example
# make lint-python
#
# @example
# make lint-python PYTHON_SOURCES_FILTER=.*/foo/bar/.*
#/
lint-python: lint-python-src

.PHONY: lint-python

#/
# Lints Python source files.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   This rule is useful when wanting to glob for Python source files (e.g., lint all Python source files in a particular directory).
#
# @param {string} [PYTHON_SOURCES_FILTER] - file path pattern (e.g., `.*/foo/bar/.*`)
# @param {*} [FAST_FAIL] - flag indicating whether to stop linting upon encountering a lint error

.PHONY: lint-python-src

#/
# Lints a specified list of Python files.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   This rule is useful when wanting to lint a list of Python files generated by some other command (e.g., a list of changed Python files obtained via `git diff`).
#
# @param {string} FILES - list of Python file paths
# @param {*} [FAST_FAIL] - flag indicating whether to stop linting upon encountering a lint error

# @example
# make lint-python-files FILES='/foo/file.py /bar/file.py'
