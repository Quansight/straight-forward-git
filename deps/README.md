This directory is the target directory for installing vendor dependencies (i.e., third-party libraries from external "vendors").

The directory is structured as follows:

-   `deps/checksums`: vendor dependency checksums.
-   `deps/test`: vendor dependency installation tests.
-   `deps/tmp`: location for storing dependency downloads.
-   `deps/build`: location for stored dependency builds.

Neither the `tmp` nor `build` directory should be committed to the project repository.
